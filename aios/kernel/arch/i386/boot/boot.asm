; downwards on x86. The stack is in its own section so it can be marked nobits,

	; machine. Interrupts are disabled. Paging is disabled. The processor
	; state is as defined in the multiboot standard. The kernel has full
	; control of the CPU. The kernel can only make use of hardware features
	; and any code it provides as part of itself. There's no printf
	; function, unless the kernel provides its own <stdio.h> header and a
	; printf implementation. There are no security restrictions, no
	; safeguards, no debugging mechanisms, only what the kernel provides
	; itself. It has absolute and complete power over the

	; The actual starting virtual address of the block is determined by which page directory entry is pointing to this page table

	; To achieve that:
	; 1. Map first 4MB virtual address to the same physical address
	; 2. Map the same 4MB physical address space from virtual address space starting at 0xC0000000, so the kernel code will start at 0xC0100000 (1MiB into that space)
	; The 1. ensure the CPU can still find the next instruction in memory once we enable paging
	; And 2. is the start of a Higher Half Kernel, see https://wiki.osdev.org/Higher_Half_x86_Bare_Bones
