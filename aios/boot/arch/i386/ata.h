/*
 BSY: a 1 means that the controller is busy executing a command. No register should be accessed (except the digital output register) while this bit is set.
RDY: a 1 means that the controller is ready to accept a command, and the drive is spinning at correct speed..
WFT: a 1 means that the controller detected a write fault.
SKC: a 1 means that the read/write head is in position (seek completed).
DRQ: a 1 means that the controller is expecting data (for a write) or is sending data (for a read). Don't access the data register while this bit is 0.
COR: a 1 indicates that the controller had to correct data, by using the ECC bytes (error correction code: extra bytes at the end of the sector that allows to verify its integrity and, sometimes, to correct errors).
IDX: a 1 indicates the the controller retected the index mark (which is not a hole on hard-drives).
ERR: a 1 indicates that an error occured. An error code has been placed in the error register.
